Shor's algorithm example in Qiskit

Given an integer N, find its prime factors.

Circuit example with N = 15 and x = 2 (reference paper: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1068)

where N and x are the coprimes.

The example was created based on the https://github.com/mett29/Shor-s-Algorithm repository.

    r"""Optimizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in Shor's algorithm using Kitaev's approach.

        This method follows the approach described in the paper:  
        [Science, 351(6277), 1068](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1068).  

        Key optimizations:
        
        1. **Semiclassical QFT**:  
           - Replaces a QFT on M qubits with a semiclassical QFT acting repeatedly on a single qubit.  
           - Uses classical feed-forward measurement to control subsequent qubit operations.  
           - Reduces the number of two-qubit gates by leveraging measurement outcomes for adaptive gate application.  
           - Reference: [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3228](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3228).  

        2. **Optimized Conditional Multiplication**:  
           - Instead of performing full multiplications, the algorithm conditionally maps  
             \(|1\rangle \to |a^{2^k} \mod N\rangle\), reducing computational overhead.  
           - This enhances fidelity and performance, as the initial operationâ€™s accuracy  
             impacts all subsequent computations.

        3. **Additional Improvements**:  
           - Requires in-sequence measurements.  
           - Uses qubit recycling to reset measured qubits.  
           - Implements feed-forward gate adjustments based on measurement results.  
           - Incorporates controlled quantum operations.  

        **Note:** A combined experiment implementing all these features has not yet been realized.
