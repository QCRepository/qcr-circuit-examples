### QCR circuit examples

This repository contains the quantum circuit examples of QCR.

The quantum circuit examples here are uploaded to QCR by the QCR team to pre-populate the repository with circuits from well-known and nominal publications.
 
The repository follows a structure where each example is organized into a standalone subfolder that contains an example script and further source files (if any). For each circuit example the `example.py` is to be run.
