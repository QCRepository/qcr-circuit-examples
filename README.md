### QCR circuit examples

This repository contains the quantum circuit examples of QCR.

The quantum circuit examples here are uploaded to QCR by the QCR team to prepopulate the repository with circuits from well-known and nominal publications.

The repository follows a structure where each example is organized into standalone subfolder with further potential source files in further folders. For each circuit example the `example.py` is to be run which uses other sources relevant for the circuit (if any).
